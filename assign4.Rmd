For the regular expression exercises, try writing first using regular expressions directly, then try using rverbalexpressions. Provide the code for both. 

```{r}
library(lubridate)
library(RVerbalExpressions)
library(stringr)
library(tidyverse)
```

# Part 1

## R4DS 16.4.5

Create a vector of dates giving the first day of every month in the current year. 
```{r}
first_dom <- ymd("2019-01-01") + months(0:11)

first_dom
```


Write a function that given your birthday (as a date), returns how old you are in years.
```{r}
how_old <- function(birthday) {
  return((birthday %--% today()) %/% years())
}

how_old(ymd(19910225))
```


Write a function that given your birthday, returns the day of the week you were born on. 
```{r}
born_weekday <- function(birthday) {
  return(wday(birthday, label=TRUE, abbr = FALSE))
}

born_weekday(ymd(19910225))
```


## R4DS 14.3.2.1

Given the corpus of common words in stringr::words, create regular expressions that find all words that have seven letters or more. (Since this list is long, you might want to use the match argument to str_view() to show only the matching or non-matching words.)
```{r}
# RegEx
str_view(stringr::words, "^[a-zA-Z]{7,}$")

# RVerbalExpressions
seven_or_more.rx <- rx() %>%
  rx_start_of_line() %>% 
  rx_any_of("a-zA-Z") %>% 
  rx_multiple(min = 7) %>% 
  rx_end_of_line()

str_view(stringr::words, seven_or_more.rx)
```


## R4DS 14.3.3.1

Use str_detect to find all words that:
That only contain consonants. (Hint: thinking about matching “not”-vowels.)
```{r}
# RegEx
words[str_detect(stringr::words, "^[^aeiou]+$")]

# RVerbalExpressions
no_vowel.rx <- rx() %>% 
  rx_start_of_line() %>% 
  rx_anything_but('aeiou') %>% 
  rx_end_of_line()

words[str_detect(stringr::words, no_vowel.rx)]
```


Empirically verify the rule “i before e except after c”.
```{r}
# RegEx -- 2 words do not follow the rule
words[str_detect(stringr::words, "!cei|.*cie")]

#RegEx -- 13 words follow the rule
words[str_detect(stringr::words, "[^c]ie")]

# RVerbalExpressions -- 2 words do not follow the rule
not_ie_rule.rx <- rx() %>% 
  rx_either_of("cie", 
               rx() %>% 
                 rx_anything() %>% 
                 rx_find("cie")
               )
# RVerbalExpressions -- 13 words follow the rule
ie_rule.rx <- rx() %>% 
  rx_something_but("c") %>%
  rx_find("ie")

words[str_detect(stringr::words, not_ie_rule.rx)]
words[str_detect(stringr::words, ie_rule.rx)]
```


Create a regular expression that will match telephone numbers as commonly written in the US. Split this up into multiple expressions as needed.
```{r}
# RegEx
grepl("^\\d{3}[-\\.]\\d{3}[-\\.]\\d{4}$", "847-373-2512")

# RVerbalExpressions
telrx <- rx() %>% 
  rx_start_of_line() %>% 
  rx_digit() %>%
  rx_repeat_previous(3) %>%
  rx_any_of('-.') %>% 
  rx_digit() %>%
  rx_repeat_previous(3) %>%
  rx_any_of('-.') %>% 
  rx_digit() %>%
  rx_repeat_previous(4) %>%
  rx_end_of_line() %>% 
  print()

grepl(telrx, "847-373-2512")
```


# Part 2

Choose a dataset (this can be the same dataset as the last assignment, or a new one). Define a predictive modeling problem. Create the appropriate files and notebooks to do the following:

1. Describe the data and the problem

2. Read in and check data

2. Clean up the data. 

*Note: You may request that score for these sections replace your score for the coding portion of Assignment 3.*

4. Using best practices, write four functions which add engineered features to the dataset, including a description and rationale. Include a test to determine whether the features are working as intended. 

5. Prepare the data for modeling

Note: this will form the basis for your midterm project. Take advantage of TA's and my office hours. We can provide feedback and guidance.
